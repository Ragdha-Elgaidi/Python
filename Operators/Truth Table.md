# Logical Operators
- AND Logical Operators
- OR Logical Operators
#### Mixing Logical Operators
- Precedence: AND before OR
So
- All conditions are ANDed
     - True IFF all ANDed conditions are true
- All conditions are ORed
     - True if any condition is true. False if all are false
- Mixed ORs and ANDs
    - Find each subgroup of ANDs and evaluate first. 
    - Do ORing for the remaining
