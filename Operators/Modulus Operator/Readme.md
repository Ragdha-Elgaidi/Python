# Modulus Operator
- a modulus n = a % n = finds the remainder after division by n: 
- let a = 27, n = 12, then r = a % n?
- 27 / 12 = (2*12 + 3)/12 = 2 + 3/12 = 2.25
- 2 = Integer division part = called the quotient
- Means we have maximum 2 multiples of 12 (2*12 = 24 <= 27)
- 0.25 = fractional part 
- 3 (remainder) of division = 27 - 24
- 27 % 12 = 3 ⇒ Remainder of division (must be < 12)
### Note
- Num % 2 ⇒ can tell us if number is even or odd
- Num % 10 ⇒ gives us the last digit of num
- Num / 10 ⇒ removes the last digit of num (integer division)
- r = n%k [r must be < k]
