# Arithmetic Operators
- Arithmetic: traditional operations (e.g. addition) on numbers
- Operator: Symbol
- Arithmetic Operators: + - * / // %
- x + 2 * y - 1
  - We call it expression
  - " + * - "are operators
  - x, 2, y, 1 are operands
- Parentheses (): applied first
##### Binary and Unary Operators
- Binary operators needs 2 operands
       - 3 + 5
       - 4 * 6
       - 5 - 2 
- Unary Operator takes 1 operand only
       - -7
       - --7 = 7
       - ---7 = -7
       - +7
       - So + and - can be used as binary and unary operator
#### Division (/) and Floor Division (//)
- Division: results in a float
- Floor division also called Integer Division: results in integer Division by power of 10s
- Dividing by 10 removes last digit
- Dividing by 100 remove last 2 digits and so on
- Notice num/1000 is same as num/10/10/10
#### Power Operator (**)
- 5 ** 3 = 53
-  5 is being raised to the 3rd power
- 5 * 5 * 5 = 5 multiplied in each self 3 times
#### Modulus Operator (%)
- Returns the remainder rather than the quotient after division
- 6 % 2 = 0 (6 is divisible by 2)
- 6 % 4 = 2 (6 is not divisible by 4)
#### Even and odd 
- Even number is divisible by 2 
    - E.g. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, …
    - 8/2 = 4 ⇒ Even
    - So always number.0
- Odd number is not divisible by 2
    - E.g. 1, 3, 5, 7, 11, …
    - Let’s divide them by 2 
    - ½ = 0.5
    - 3/2 = 1.5
    - So 0.5 1.5 2.5 3.5 4.5 5.5
    - Like 0.5 + (1, 2, 3, 4, 5….)
    - So always number.5
